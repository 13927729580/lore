Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

Lore is compatible with both python 2 and 3. Use pip to install the latest version.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ pip install lore


Create a New App
----------------

With Lore installed, you can create a new app for deep learning projects while you read on. Lore is modular and slim by default, so weâ€™ll need to specify --keras to install deep learning dependencies for this project.

.. code-block:: shell

  $ lore init my_app --python-version=3.6.5 --keras
