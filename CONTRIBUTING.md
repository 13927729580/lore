### Release Checklist:
* Did you add any required properties to Model/Estimator/Pipeline or other Base classes? You need to provide default values for serialized objects during deserialization.
* Did you add any new modules? You need to specify them in setup.py: packages.
* Did you add any new dependencies? You need to test against released versions, and specify which are supported in setup.py.
